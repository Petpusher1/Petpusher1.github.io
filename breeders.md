Produced by us she is the daughter of Monster and an un named female who was a Platinum. She hatched in Feb. 21' and was the larger of the 2. Both Parents are wild caught so Munch is a first generation CB. She is Het Platinum, we don't knoe if her father has any hidden hets but hope to find out with this pairing.

Ivory was purchased in a pet store so we don't know if she has unknown hets we estimate she was hatched in June 22'. Her visual morph is snow stripe, so her known genes are stripe, anery and amel.
