<img src="images/Munch 9-23.jpg" alt="Munch" width="400"/>

Produced by us she is the daughter of Monster and an un named female who was a Platinum. She hatched in Feb. 21' and was the larger of the 2. Both Parents are wild caught so Munch is a first generation CB. She is Het Platinum, we don't knoe if her father has any hidden hets but hope to find out with this pairing.

### Crunch and Monster (Tokay Gecko)
<img src="images/Crunch and Monster.jpg" alt="Crunch and Monster" width="400"/>

Crunch is the other female Fathered by monster and the Platinum female, thus making her Het. Platinum hatched in Feb.2021 this will be her first year breeding for 2024. Monster is a wild caught male so we don't know if he has any hidden hets. We hope to find out when he produces offspring with his daughter in the 2024 season.

### un named (Tokay Gecko)
<img src="images/New Addition 2023-10-03.jpg" alt="un named" width="400"/>

She is a new addition and was sold to us as a male but turned out to be female. She is wild caught and is being brought to a healthy weight before we pair her with a male.

### Nibler (Tokay Gecko)
<img src="images/Nibler.jpg" alt="Nibler" width="400"/>

Nibler is also wild caught and was sold to us as a male but turned out to be a female. She may posess unknown hets and has been brought to a healthy weight but I don't have a spare male to pair her with at this time.

### Chomper (Tokay Gecko)
<img src="images/Chomper.jpg" alt="Chomper" width="400"/>

Chomper was purchased from Emerald Exotics and was recently paired with Munch but they didn't sucessfully produce any eggs. They were paired for almost 3 months when suddenly he was being injured by munch so he has been seperated to recoup from his injuries. I hope to pair him with Nibler. He is Captive bred and a proven producer of Granite offspring.

### Amber (Crested gecko)
<img src="images/Amber.jpg" alt="Amber" width="400"/>

<img src="images/Big Daddy.jpg" alt="Big Daddy" width="400"/>

Big Daddy is an Super Cream Extream Harlequin, pos Het Sable male with a big head and crests.  He has produced a lot of babies over the years but I haven't hung on to any long enough to see their progression.

### Pos Sable holdback (Crested gecko)

### Pos Sable holdback (Crested gecko)
<img src="images/Pos Sable holdback 4-copy.jpg" alt="Pos Sable holdback side view" width="400"/>

This is an offspring of Big Daddy, I only just learned about the Sable gene and when they were talking about the look of the babies it had striking resemblance to his offspring.  They are described as having orangish coration and dark tips on the tails, which nearly all his offspring have had.  So I am going to hold this one back and see if the white brightenes and expands on the crests and body.


### Dalmation Pair (Crested gecko)
<img src="images/Dalmation Pair.jpg" alt="Dalmation Pair" width="400"/>

The male when fired up is a pewter gray color with black spots and the female is a cream harlequin with dalmation spots.
